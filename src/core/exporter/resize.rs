//! Output size envelope: scale so the longest side lands in [MIN_SIZE, MAX_SIZE].
//!
//! Every route ends at the exporter, and the exporter starts here — so this is the one place the
//! envelope is enforced, and no route can bypass it.
//!
//! The scale is always uniform: aspect ratio is preserved, so a route that hands over a square gets
//! a square back. Today R1 and R2 are stubs and pass the original through un-squared, which is why
//! this works on the longest side rather than assuming a square input.
