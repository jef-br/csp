//! Shot classifier: is the subject touching an image border?
//!
//! A bounding box can't answer this reliably — the box can touch an
//! edge while the actual subject silhouette doesn't (or vice versa for
//! a diagonal pose). This module answers it with segmentation instead,
//! in two passes:
//!
//! - **Pass 1** ([`gate`]): a cheap scan of the segmentation mask's
//!   border-adjacent band, per edge, to decide which edges are even
//!   worth checking precisely. This is the filter that keeps the
//!   expensive path off the common case (subject nowhere near an edge).
//! - **Pass 2** ([`refine`]): for edges pass 1 flagged, intersects the
//!   mask with the border band, rescales that region to full original
//!   resolution, crops it, and refines the boundary there via a
//!   trimap + color-distance matting step — because the segmentation
//!   mask is upsampled from a lower internal resolution and isn't
//!   pixel-accurate at the boundary. Only the refined, full-resolution
//!   result decides touching or not.
//!
//! [`segmentation::SegmentationModel`] abstracts the actual BiRefNet
//! inference call, so the gate/refine logic can be exercised against a
//! stand-in model. [`super::classify`] wires the real one up and feeds
//! [`classify_instance`] the preprocessor's two resolutions.
