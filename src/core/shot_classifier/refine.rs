//! Pass 2: pixel-perfect edge refinement.
//!
//! Only call [`refine_edge`] for edges [`super::gate::gate`] already
//! flagged - this does the real work pass 1 exists to avoid paying for
//! on every instance:
//!
//! 1. Intersect the working-resolution mask with the border band to find where along the edge the subject actually reaches.
//!    (not the whole mask, just the slice near this edge) 
//! 2. Map that region back to the original image and crop it at full res.
//!    In-memory crop; the region is also reported on [`EdgeRefinement::crop_region`] for callers that want it.
//! 3. Build a trimap from the upsampled working-resolution mask:
//!    - interior = foreground
//!    - exterior = background, a ring around the
//!    - boundary = unknown (= where upsampling made the mask inaccurate).
//! 4. Classify each unknown pixel by color distance to sampled FGC vs. BGC, at full res.
//! 5. The refined mask, not the raw BiRefNet mask, says whether the boundary reaches the border at all.
//! 6. A contact that reaches the border still has to earn the verdict:
//!    [`is_graze`] rejects the ones where the silhouette runs along the edge rather than off it.
