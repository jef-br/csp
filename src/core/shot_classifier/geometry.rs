//! Edge-relative coordinate handling.
//!
//! The one idea this module exists for: every per-edge algorithm in this
//! crate (border-band scanning, background-color sampling, the trimap
//! ring) is written exactly once, in "top edge, depth increasing
//! downward" terms, against the [`Grid`] trait. [`EdgeView`] then presents
//! any of the other three edges as if they were the top edge, by
//! transposing/flipping coordinates. Nothing edge-specific lives outside
//! this file.
