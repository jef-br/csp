//! R1 step 1 — where the square goes.
//!
//! Pure geometry, no pixels. Two rules, one per axis:
//!
//! * **Size.** An axis with at least one free side needs `extent * (1 + margin)`. An axis blocked
//!   on both sides needs exactly `extent` — the subject runs off the frame at both ends, so there
//!   is no gap to leave and nothing to leave it with. The square's side is the larger of the two
//!   needs, so the tighter axis decides.
//! * **Placement.** The slack on each axis goes to that axis's free sides: split between them when
//!   both are free, all of it to the one that is free otherwise. A blocked side never moves —
//!   the subject continues past it, and background invented there would be background painted over
//!   a subject we cannot see.
//!
//! A 0-edge subject is the degenerate case of this, not a separate one: four free sides, so both
//! axes take the full margin and both split it evenly.
//!
//! Deriving the side from the subject rather than from the image is what makes the square able to
//! reach past a border. That is not a failure mode — it is the case R1 exists for. A side that
//! lands inside the image simply crops there; a side that reaches past it leaves an [`Overhang`]
//! for the fill to cover.
