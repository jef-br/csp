//! Routing: turn the shot classifier's verdict into one of three processing routes.
//!
//! | Route | Verdict | Strategy |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | R1 [`Route::CenterAndStretch`] | a usable mask with room to grow | square around the subject, bled edges pinned, background stretched to fill |
//! | R2 [`Route::CropSquare`] | no usable mask, or no room to grow | take the largest square already in the frame |
//! | R3 [`Route::Fallback`] | no verdict at all | fit the whole image into a square canvas |
//!
//! **The bleed table lives inside R1.** `docs/csp-spec.md` §5 lists five behaviours for a subject
//! that reaches an edge. Four of them are one rule seen from four angles: a bled edge is blocked,
//! an axis with a free side takes the margin, and the slack goes to the free sides.
//! [`center_and_stretch`] applies that rule, so those four never reach [`Route::select`] as a
//! routing decision at all.
//!
//! **What does reach it is whether framing is possible.** R2 is not "the other bleed case" — it is
//! the answer to "there is nothing here to frame around, or no room to do it in". Three verdicts
//! say that, and [`crop_square`] explains each.
//!
//! R3 is not a spec row. It exists because "the model produced no verdict" is a genuinely
//! different state from any verdict the model did produce — see [`Route::select`].
