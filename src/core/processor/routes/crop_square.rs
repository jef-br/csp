//! R2 — crop a square out of the frame.
//!
//! The route for images where framing *around* the subject is the wrong move, either because
//! there is no usable subject to frame around or because the frame cannot grow to hold one. It
//! adds nothing: it takes the largest square the image already contains, centred.
//!
//! Three verdicts arrive here (see [`super::Route::select`]):
//!
//! * **The mask covers too little of the frame to be a subject.** A close-up where the segmenter
//!   latched onto one high-contrast detail. Cropping to that detail magnifies a speck; padding
//!   around the whole image adds white to a picture that is already all product. Taking a square
//!   out of it is the only move that neither invents nor magnifies.
//! * **Left and right both bled, and nothing else.** The subject spans the full width, so the
//!   square can be at most that wide — and the subject is taller than that. R1 would have to
//!   stretch a blocked axis to fit, which would paint background over a subject running off-frame.
//!   Cropping into the height is the answer instead.
//! * **All four edges bled.** The subject's box *is* the frame. Nowhere to put a margin, no
//!   background band anywhere to stretch from.
//!
//! Centred on the *frame*, not on the mask. Two of the three cases arrive here precisely because
//! the mask is not to be trusted, and the third has a subject spanning the whole width — so the
//! frame is the more reliable anchor in all three.
//!
//! `docs/csp-spec.md` §6's CoG/MSR square is the refinement this leaves room for: anchor the crop
//! on the saliency-weighted centre rather than the frame's middle. Nothing in the 37-image set
//! needs it yet.
