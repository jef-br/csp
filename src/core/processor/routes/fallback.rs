//! R3 — no verdict (EIX not set).
//!
//! Reached when the classifier could not produce an answer at all: a failed inference, an unusable
//! model output. There is no subject box to anchor on, so this route makes no claim about where the
//! subject is — it fits the *whole* image, uncropped, into a square canvas sized to the original's
//! largest dimension, centred, with the remainder filled white.
//!
//! Nothing is cropped and nothing is scaled, so a wrong guess here costs framing, never pixels. It
//! is the safe answer for "we don't know", which is why it is a route of its own rather than a
//! degenerate case of R1.
