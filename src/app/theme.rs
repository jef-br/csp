//! Console styling shared by the shell: the palette, the full-width rule, and the callout line
//! that closes every screen — `⏵` marker, text, and the right-aligned version slug.
//!
//! Hand-tuned on purpose — there is no logic here beyond the callout's padding. Colours are
//! 24-bit ANSI, matching the hex values in the design mockups; `console::init` turns VT processing
//! on before any of this is printed. Classic conhost quantises truecolour to its nearest 16, which
//! is an acceptable degradation — Windows Terminal is the target.
