//! Throttled, in-place batch progress bar with a fixed footer under it.
//!
//! `batch::run` fans work across cores with rayon and calls [`Progress::tick`] once per finished
//! file from whatever worker thread finished it. Redraws are throttled to ~15 Hz through a
//! non-blocking `try_lock`: a worker that can't take the gate just bumps the counter and returns,
//! so the bar never sits on the batch's critical path. The bar disables itself when stdout is not
//! a terminal, which keeps it out of the piped `<exe> <in> <out>` dev path.
//!
//! The footer is the block the shell wants held under the bar — the rule / callout / rule that
//! tells the user how to interrupt. It is drawn once, with the first frame, and then left alone:
//! only the bar line ever changes, so every later frame steps the cursor up to that one line,
//! rewrites it, and steps back down. Nothing else writes to stdout while the batch runs (failures
//! are collected, not printed), so the block stays where it was first drawn.
//!
//! Each frame goes out in a single `write_all`. Rust's stdout is a `LineWriter` and flushes on
//! every newline it is handed, so printing the block line by line put a half-drawn frame on screen
//! fifteen times a second — which the terminal is free to composite. That was the flicker.
