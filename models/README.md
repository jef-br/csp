# models

Every BiRefNet `.onnx` export lives here and nowhere else. The files themselves
are gitignored (`*.onnx`) — they are build inputs, not source — so this README is
the only committed file, and it is what makes the folder exist in a fresh clone.

`build.rs` reads exactly one of them:

```rust
const MODEL_DIR:  &str = "models";
const MODEL_FILE: &str = "birefnet_lite_384_int8.onnx";
```

`MODEL_FILE` is a bare filename resolved inside this folder. It is the single
switch that decides which export gets encrypted and compiled into the exe — so
dropping a new variant in here changes nothing until that line names it.

A missing `MODEL_FILE` fails the **build**, naming the path. That is deliberate:
the exe ships as one file with the weights inside it, so a model that isn't
there must be caught at build time, never at run time.

Add as many variants as you like while experimenting — `tools/2. export_onnx.py`
writes new exports straight into this folder, and `tools/3. quantize_int8.py`
writes its output beside its input. See `tools/README.md` for the pipeline.
